# Algorithms-and-Big-O-notation-C#

A small cheat sheet for understanding the time and space complexity of algorithms:


- <strong>O(N!)</strong> - The worst of everyone else. The bigger the input the bigger is time. The most complex.

- <strong>O(2^N)</strong> - A better Version of O(N!), but less complex and still takes a while.

- <strong>O(N^3)</strong> - The less complex version of previous 2. But input^3=time.

- <strong>O(N^2)</strong> - Like O(N^3), but less complex and input^2=time.

- <strong>O(n log(n))</strong> AKA loglinear complexity - operations will occur *n* times

- <strong>O(n)</strong> - Time or space will increase the bigger is the input.

- <strong>O(log n)</strong> -  Time increases logarithmically to increase input *n*.

- <strong>O(1)</strong> - the algorithm has constant complexity and in code could be described as the amount of time or memory that does not scale with *n*.
