- O(N!) - The worst of everyone else. The bigger the input the bigger is time. The most complex.

- O(2^N) - A better Version of O(N!), but less complex and still takes a while.

- O(N^3) - The less complex version of previous 2. But input^3=time.

- O(N^2) - Like O(N^3), but less complex and input^2=time.

- O(n log(n)) AKA loglinear complexity - operations will occur *n* times
